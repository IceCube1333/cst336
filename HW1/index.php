                <p>Computer graphics are photos and video clips created using computers. The term usually refers to computer-generated <br/>
                image data created with specialized graphic hardware and software. It is a huge area in computer <br/>
                science. It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as computer-generated imagery (CGI). <br/> <br/>
                
                Some of the topics in computer graphics include 2D models, sprite graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, <br/>
                implicit surface visualization with ray tracing, and computer vision, among many more. <br/> <br/>
                
                Computer graphics is used for displaying art and image data to the user. Computer graphic development has <br/>
                had a massive impact on many different types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, <br/>
                video games, and graphic design generally.</p><br/> <br/>
