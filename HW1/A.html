                    A big form of digital art, pixel art is created by using <br/>
                    raster graphics software, where images are edited on the pixel level. <br/>
                    Graphics in most older computer and video games, graphing calculator games,<br/>
                    and many mobile phone games are in pixel art.<br/> <br/>
                    
                    <span class="standOut">Sprite Graphics</span> <br/> <br/>
                    A sprite is a 2D image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene. <br/>
                    It initially included just graphical objects handled separately from the memory bitmap of a <br/>
                    video display, but this now includes various manners of graphical overlays.<br/>
                    Sprites were originally a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared <br/>
                    to be part of the normal bitmap on a screen. <br/> <br/>
