                <p id="C">Computer animation is the art of creating moving images through the use of <br/>
                computers. It is created through the use of 3D computer graphics, though <br/>
                2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and <br/>
                faster real-time rendering needs.  It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated <br/>
                imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films. <br/> <br/>
        
                To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the screen and then <br/>
                quickly replaced by new images that are similar to the previous image, but shifted <br/>
                slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in television and motion pictures.</p> <br/> <br/>
